# ThermOHL

ThermOHL is a python module to compute temperature (given environment
parameters) or maximum transit intensity (given a maximum temperature
and environment parameters) in overhead line conductors.

## Features

Three temperature models are currently available: 

* one using CIGRE recommendations, 
* one using an IEEE standard,
* two others from RTE (R&D olla and RTE). 

Steady-state versions cover both temperature and transit solver; concerning transient version, only the temperature is
implemented. Probabilistic simulations with random inputs are only possible with the steady-state solvers.
